Temperature Growth Factor Beta (TGF-`β`)
======================================

In this example we show how to combine torsional moves of a ligand and a nearby Ser82 residue in a TGF-`β`
complex. The following script depends on a :download:`coordinate <../../examples/TGF/structure.gro>` and a
:download:`topology <../../examples/TGF/structure.top>` file.
